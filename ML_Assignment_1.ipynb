    "### Q1: Explain the following with an example:\n",
    "#### Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad science of mimicking human abilities. It involves creating systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Siri, Google's AI-powered search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves teaching computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Email spam filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various factors of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Image recognition systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The algorithm learns to predict the output from the input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "- Linear regression\n",
    "- Decision trees\n",
    "- Support vector machines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "- K-means clustering\n",
    "- Principal component analysis\n",
    "- Hierarchical clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the overarching concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "DL (Deep Learning) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze various factors of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "DS (Data Science) is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train the model, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns and structures, and semi-supervised learning uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The train, test, and validation split is a common strategy for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Train Set:** Used to train the model.\n",
    "- **Validation Set:** Used to tune the model's hyperparameters.\n",
    "- **Test Set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying patterns that do not conform to expected behavior. Algorithms like clustering and dimensionality reduction can be used to detect anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8: List down some commonly used supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning Algorithms:**\n",
    "- Linear Regression\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "- Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:**\n",
    "- K-means Clustering\n",
    "- Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "- Association Rules\n"
